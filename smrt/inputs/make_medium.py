"""
The helper functions in this module are used to create snowpacks, sea-ice and other media. They are user-friendly and recommended
for most usages. Extension of these functions is welcome on the condition they keep a generic structure.

The function :py:func:`~smrt.inputs.make_medium.make_snowpack` is the first entry point the user should consider to build a snowpack.
For example::

    from smrt import make_snowpack

    sp = make_snowpack([1000], density=[300], microstructure_model='sticky_hard_spheres', radius=[0.3e-3], stickiness=0.2)

creates a semi-infinite snowpack made of sticky hard spheres with radius 0.3mm and stickiness 0.2.
The :py:obj:`~smrt.core.Snowpack` object is in the `sp` variable.

Note that any layer with zero thickness is completely removed in most of these functions (as well as its top interface), 
and a transparent layer is added if the resulting medium does not have any layer. This allows simulation of bare soil and bare ice 
more easily. It is important to understand that any layer with non-zero thickness, even much smaller than the wavelength, even
10^-20 m, has an impact in the radiative transfer framework due to the reflection, transmission and refraction. In reality,
and according to the wave theory such sub-wavelength layers and their interface should have reduced or close to zero impact.
It is the responsability of the user to ensure that such thin layers (less than a quarter of wavelength) are removed from
the snowpack. Alternatively setting the `process_coherent_layers` option when using the
`smrt.rtsolver.dort` solver allows to deal with sub-wavelength layers provided they are isolated between two thick layers.

Note that `make_snowpack` is directly imported from `smrt` instead of `smrt.inputs.make_medium`. This feature is for convenience.

    """build a multi-layered medium using a pandas DataFrame (or a dict that can be transformed into a DataFrame) and optinal arguments.
The 'medium' column (or key) in data indicates the medium type: 'snow' or 'ice'. If not given, it defaults to 'snow'.
'data' must contain enough information to build either a snowpack or an ice_column. The minimum requirements are:
    - for a snowpack: ('z' or 'thickness'), 'density', 'microstructure_model' and the arguments required by the microstructural_model.
    - for a ice column: ice_type, ('z' or 'thickness'), 'temperature', 'salinity', 'microstructure_model' and the arguments required by
    the microstructural_model.

When reading a dataframe from disk for instance, it is convenient to use df.rename(columns={...}) to map the column names of the file
to the column names required by SMRT.

if 'z' is given, the thickness is deduced using :py:meth:`~smrt.core.inputs.make_medium.compute_thickness_from_z`.

** Warning **: Using this function is a bit dangerous as any unrecognized column names are silently ignored.
For instance, a column named 'Temperature' is ignore (due to the uppercase), and the temperature in the snowpack
will be set to its default value (273.15 K). This issue applies to any optional argument. Double ckeck the spelling of the columns.

** Note **: `make_medium` create laters using all the columns in the dataframe. It means that any column name becomes an attribute of
 the layer objects, even if not recognized/used by SMRT. This can be seen as an interesting feature to store information in layers,
 but this is also dangerous if column names collide with internal layer attributes or method names. For this reason,
this function is unsecure if the snowpack data are pulled from the internet. Always check the content of the file, and it is recommended 
to drop all the unnecessary columns with df.drop(columns=[...])) before calling make_medium.
