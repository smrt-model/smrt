Provide the Multi-Fresnel Thermal Emission (MFTE) RT solver for passive sensor.

Multi-Fresnel Thermal Emission (MFTE) is a fast RT solver suitable for passive microwave and none scattering
media. It computes the thermal emission of a multi-layer stack of homogeneous layers (absorption only, no scattering)
with flat interfaces (no roughness) solely characterized by their permittivity and temperature. It is most suitable for
instance for L-band and lower frequencies over the dry zone of the ice-sheet where the penetration is deep and the
stratification of the snowpack and the profile of temperature are crucial to compute the emission.
Note that the layers are incoherent, layer thickness smaller than the wavelength are not recommended (at least not smaller than a
quarter of the wavelength). In principle, MFTE gives the same results as DORT, when the aforementioned assumption are
respected, but much more rapidely.

Even with a small number of layers, MFTE is x30 faster than DORT, and requires much less memory.
The performance difference increases with the number of layers.

The model is inspired from:

HÃ©bert, M., Simonot, L., & Mazauric, S. (2015). Matrix method to predict the spectral reflectance of stratified surfaces
including thick layers and thin films. https://hal.science/hal-01155614

The formulation (with typos) is in the Annex:

        error_handling: If set to "exception" (the default), raise an exception in cause of error, stopping the code.
            If set to "nan", return a nan, so the calculation can continue, but the result is of course unusuable and
            the error message is not accessible. This is only recommended for long simulations that sometimes produce an error.

            This prevents numerical unstability inherent to the MFTE formulation for a very deep snowpack.
            A value of 10 is used by default which is already very large / safe. In case of problems of stability, this
            value should be decreased. Set to None to deactivate pruning, but this is not recommended.
