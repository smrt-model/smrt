"""Mixing formulae relevant to saline snow. This module contains equations to compute the effective permittivity of saline snow. 

These functions are to be used with py:meth:`~smrt.emmodel.iba.derived_IBA` or
py:meth:`~smrt.emmodel.symsce_torquato21.derived_SymSCETK21` to change the default of most emmodels (IBA, DMRT, SFT
Rayleigh, SCE) using the generic mixing formula Polder van Staten that automatically mixes the permittivities of the
background (e.g.) and the scatterer materials (e.g. saline ice) to compute the effective permittivity of snow in a proportion
determined by frac_volume.

They should not be used to set the material permittivities as input of py:meth:`~smrt.smrt_inputs.make_snowpack` and
similar functions (because the emmodel would re-mix the already mixed materials with the background material).
