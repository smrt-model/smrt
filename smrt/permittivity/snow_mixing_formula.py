"""Mixing formulae relevant to snow. This module contains equations to compute the effective permittivity of snow.

Note that by default most emmodels (IBA, DMRT, SFT Rayleigh) uses the generic mixing formula Polder van Staten that mixes the permittivities
of the background (e.g.) and the scatterer materials (e.g. ice) to compute the effective permittivity of snow in a proportion
determined by frac_volume. See py:meth:`~smrt.emmolde.derived_IBA`.

Many semi-empirical mixing formulae have been developed for specific mixture of materials (e.g. snow). They can be used to replace
the Polder van Staten in the EM models. They should not be used to set the material permittivities
as input of py:meth:`~smrt.smrt_inputs.make_snowpack` and similar functions (because the emmodel would re-mix
the already mixed materials with the background material).
