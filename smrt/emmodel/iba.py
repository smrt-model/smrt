    Improved Born Approximation electromagnetic model class.

    As with all electromagnetic modules, this class is used to create an electromagnetic
    object that holds information about the effective permittivity, extinction coefficient and
    phase function for a particular snow layer. Due to the frequency dependence, information
    about the sensor is required. Passive and active sensors also have different requirements on
    the size of the phase matrix as redundant information is not calculated for the
    passive case.

    :param layer: object containing snow layer characteristics (single layer)
    :dense_snow_correction: set how snow denser than half the ice density (ie. fractional volume larger than 0.5 is handled).
        "auto" means that snow is modeled as air bubble in ice instead of ice spheres in air. The default is None


    **Usage Example:**

        This class is not normally accessed directly by the user, but forms part of the
        smrt model, together with the radiative solver (in this example, `dort`) i.e.:

            model = make_model("iba", "dort")
