"""Compute scattering from Improved Born Approximation theory with altered effective and apparent permittivities. 

This version is a modification of the original model to use the Maxwell-Garnet (MG) permittivity instead of the Polder
van Santen (PvS) as the effective permittivity. For consistency, the apparent permittivity used in IBA (MÃ¤tzler, 1998)
is also adapted based on Shivola and Kong, 1988 which details the relationship between apparent and effective
permititviies and gives examples for MG and PvS.

This is modification is useful for instance to compare with the Strong Constrast Expansion (the non symmetrized
versions) which uses the MG permittivity.
