""" Compute scattering with DMRT QCA Short range. Short range means that it is accurate only for small
and weakly sticky spheres (high stickiness value). It diverges (increasing scattering coefficient) if these conditions
are not met. Numerically the size conditions can be evaluated with the ratio radius/wavelength as for Rayleigh scatterers.
For the stickiness, it is more difficult as this depends on the size of the scatterers and the fractional volume. In any case, it is
dangerous to use too small a stickiness value, especially if the grains are big.

This model is only compatible with the SHS microstructure model.

Examples::

    from smrt import make_snowpack, make_sensor

    density = [345.0]
    temperature = [260.0]
    thickness = [70]
    radius = [750e-6]
    stickiness = [0.1]

    snowpack = make_snowpack(thickness, "sticky_hard_spheres",
                        density=density, temperature=temperature, radius=radius, stickiness=stickiness)


    # create the EM Model - Equivalent DMRTML

    # create the sensor
    theta = np.arange(5.0, 80.0, 5.0)
