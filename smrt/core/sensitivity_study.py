""" SensitivityStudy is used to easily conduct sensitivity studies. A more modern alternative is to use a pandas.DataFrame of snowpacks.

Example::

    times = [datetime(2012, 1, 1), datetime(2012, 1, 5), , datetime(2012, 1, 10)]
    snowpacks = SensitivityStudy("time", times, [snowpack_1jan, snowpack_5jan, snowpack_10jan])


    res = model.run(sensor, snowpacks)

The `res` variable is a :py:class:`Result` instance, so that for all the methods of this class that can be called, they will return a timeseries.
For instance result.TbV(theta=53) returns a time-series of brightness temperature at V polarization and 53Â° incidence angle and the following code
plots this timeseries::

    plot(times, result.TbV(theta=53))
